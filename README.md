# PDF QA Bot

## PDF QA Bot - AI-Powered Question Answering

PDF QA Bot is an interactive AI-based application that allows users to ask questions from a PDF document. It leverages **FAISS** for efficient embedding storage and **Ollama's Llama 3.2 model** for generating responses, enabling quick and accurate information retrieval from PDFs.

## How It Works

1. **Upload a PDF**: The application loads and processes the PDF document.
2. **Text Embedding**: The content is split into chunks and converted into vector embeddings using `sentence-transformers`.
3. **Search & Retrieve**: FAISS is used to efficiently search and retrieve relevant text based on user queries.
4. **Generate Response**: Ollamaâ€™s Llama 3.2 model generates answers based on the retrieved context.
5. **Interactive Q&A**: Users can ask multiple questions interactively.
